# Android Instructions

Our Android application is available to download from Google Play

[![Download at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&referrer=utm_source%3Dgithub-homepage)

On installing the Meshtastic app, load it and navigate to the settings page. Here you will ba able to select a nearby Meshtastic node, which you then need to pair with using your phone's operating system. Some nodes have buttons allowing you to change the page displayed on the nodes screen. If you double click this node, it will set the pairing code to `123456`

There is a beta program for the app, which will let you test the cutting edge changes, though this may come with extra bugs. You can join this via Google Play. It is recommended that you follow the [Meshtastic Discourse Alpha Testers](https://meshtastic.discourse.group/c/development/alpha-testers) if you decide to join this.

The app uses anonymous usage statistics and crash reports to allow us to catch problems with Meshtastic and fix them. You can disable this by unticking the checkbox on the settings page.
